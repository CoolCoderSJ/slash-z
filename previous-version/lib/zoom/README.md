# Zoom.us Golang Client Library

Note from Zach:

FYI that I was using https://github.com/himalayan-institute/zoom-lib-golang in `slash-z`, but I needed to modify it to add some features that were missing. Rather than fork it and deal with having multiple repos, I vendorized it into this repo.

Thank you to @rafecolton for making this wonderful package. Saved me so much time!
