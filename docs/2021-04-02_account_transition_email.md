Subject: Zoom Pro account transition

Hi, I'm reaching out because you have a Zoom Pro license provided by Hack Club (for [RECIPIENT_EMAIL]), which will downgrade to Zoom Basic on April 23rd in favor of [/z](https://hack.af/z), our new method for creating Zoom Pro meetings.

Last fall, [we promised to pay for Zoom Pro licenses to every club for a semester](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGT/p1599681575158900). Since then we've been [building](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0M8PUPU6/p1615326258370000) [a](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0M8PUPU6/p1616619160322200)[better](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0M8PUPU6/p1616681688357100) [alternative](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0M8PUPU6/p1617115767045400) and now we're offering Zoom Pro meetings indefinitely through /z. These new meetings have the features of your own Zoom Pro account-- start one whenever you want, for as long as you want.

You can start a meeting right now by running "/z" in a DM or public channel on the [Hack Club Slack](https://slack.hackclub.com/).

We even built a nifty calendar integration for /z you can install at [hack.af/z-install](https://hack.af/z-install), so you can schedule meetings straight from Google Calendar with two clicks:

Everyone at HQ has been using only /z for the past month, to make sure we wouldn't ship anything that we're not using ourselves.

Since HQ started providing Zoom Pro accounts to Hack Clubs in September, all of you and your clubs have done amazing things:

-   6,498 meetings were hosted with a total of 80,796 participants
-   3,185,449 minutes were spent in Hack Club meetings (that's 2,212 days, or 6+ years!)
-   Hack Clubbers have joined meetings from 112 countries

Again, start using /z for your Zoom Meetings-- we're planning to support it long-term. You can find more details at [hack.af/z](https://hack.af/z), but please let me know if you have any questions. We will shut down all legacy Zoom Pro licenses on April 23rd.

p.s. curious how it works? [the server](https://github.com/hackclub/slash-z) & [calendar addon](https://github.com/hackclub/slash-z-google-calendar) are open source
