Couple things on my plate:

- [ ] integration for 3rd parties to use slash-z
- [ ] get off of airtable
  - airtable goes down a couple times a year and my DMs explode b/c noone can join a meeting
  - we're doing crazy record trimming to stay under airtable's 50k record limit, and that sucks
  - would be nice to have something more performant anyways
- [ ] better bug tracking & log tracking
